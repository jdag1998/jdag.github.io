<h3>Greets, This is Juan Daniel I am an industrial engineer and briefly I am going to explain wha it is an industrial engineer</h3>

<div>Industrial engineering is a branch of engineering management concerned with how to make or do things better, 
    crossing a range of disciplines associated with manufacturing industrial or consumer products. This may involve increasing efficiency, 
    reducing production costs, improving quality control, ensuring the health and safety of employees, protecting the environment or complying with government regulations.

    Industrial engineers work to reduce any waste of time, money, materials, energy or other commodities by streamlining procedures and
     processes. This is achieved through the application of specialist knowledge and skills to specify, predict and evaluate results from processes and systems. 
     The results of this allow for new processes and systems to be produced, with business administration activities overlapping with areas such as production
      and manufacturing engineering, operations research, systems and supply chain engineering, management science and engineering, safety engineering, 
      ergonomic and logistics engineering and more depending on the needs of the user.
