<h2>Juan Daniel Andrade</h2>
<h3>Greets, This is Juan Daniel and this is my Web Page</h3>
<br> I was born in Ecuador, I came to the US on 2018 to study university and
work in the US. </break>
<p>I get my BS in Industrial Engineering. I enjoy working in the US,
  and I am looking to combine my technical skills with my future Software Engineering skills.
  I want to find a job that can combine my skills, and in the future have the flexibility to
  work remote. 
I love soccer and here at the bottom there is a list about the best players for me

<p>I chose a soccer player as an image that can describe because this soccer player is very good
  and the most important about him at least for me is that more than money he enjoys playing soccer. 
  He loves playing soccer is something that makes him happy, and for me is the same. I relief stress 
  and I feel Happy  while I am playing soccer.
